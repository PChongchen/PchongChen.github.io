abstract: 'This paper proposed a comprehensive synthesis of fractional order PIλDµ
  (FOPIλDµ) controller analytical design, which is illustrated through the typical
  first order plus normalized time delay (FOPNTD) systems, with fulfilling five frequency-domain
  specifications simultaneously: phase margin (φm), gain margin (Am), phase crossover
  frequency (ωpc ), gain crossover frequency (ωgc ) and a ‘‘flat phase’’ constraint.
  The control loop shape can be adjusted with wide freedom according to the five design
  specifications, which can all be beneficial on optimizing the control system: ωgc
  represents the system control bandwidth and response speed, φm and Am guarantee
  the stability, and flat phase constraint keeps the system with iso-damping property
  on robustness of loop gain variations. The impact of ωpc adjustment is thoroughly
  discovered via frequency-domain analysis and also time-domain analysis with low-frequency
  disturbance and high-frequency noise. The frequency response functions are presented
  to show the loop-shaping advantages of the proposed synthesis scheme. A further
  in-depth study on designing guideline is also presented: the feasible region of
  four specifications, e.g. ωgc , ωpc , φm and Am, can all be collected and visualized
  in the multi-dimensional graphics. This feasible region gives users prior information
  and great flexibility before the controller design. Simulation results using the
  designed FOPIλDµ controller are carried out to demonstrate the performance advantages
  over the optimized integer-order PID, three-parameter FOPID, fractional filter-fractional
  order PID and Ziegler–Nichols FOPID controllers.'
