abstract: This article proposes a two-degree-of-freedom fractional-order proportional
  derivative (FOPD) controller with a general extended state observer (GESO) to achieve
  both optimal set-speed tracking and disturbance rejection performance for a typical
  permanent magnet synchronous motor servo system. The GESO simplifies the control
  plant, estimates and actively rejects total disturbances. The FOPD controller achieves
  fast speed tracking with almost no overshoot. Furthermore, it is verified that the
  control system with the proposed FOPD-GESO controller design meets the separation
  principle through mathematical derivation and simulation illustration. It shows
  that the proposed controller breaks the inherent tradeoff on tracking performance
  and disturbance robustness of the typical traditional proportional–integral–derivative
  (PID) control. Meanwhile, a systematic scheme for designing the FOPD-GESO controller
  to satisfy both frequency-domain and time-domain specifications is proposed in this
  article. Simulation illustration and experimental validation are performed to demonstrate
  that the proposed FOPD-GESO controller is superior to the typical integer-order
  PID controller, integer-order active disturbance rejection control with a typical
  extended state observer, and fractional-order PID controller in terms of speed tracking,
  antiload disturbance, and robustness to internal uncertainties.
