abstract: In this paper, a practical and systematic tuning procedure combining both
  frequency-domain (FD) and time-domain (TD) specifications is proposed to obtain
  an optimal robust fractional order (FO) PIλD (FOPIλD) controller for the first order
  plus time delay (FOPTD) processes. The FD specifications (i.e. phase margin (PM),
  gain crossover frequency (ωgc ) and flat phase constrain (FPC)) guarantee the systemic
  stability and robustness to plant gain variations. Meanwhile, the TD specification
  (i.e. the smallest JITAE ) achieves optimal dynamic performance. Furthermore, the
  entire feasible regions of two frequency-domain specifications ωgc and PM have been
  obtained with a synthesis scheme and visualized in three-dimensional plots which
  can be used as prior knowledge before the controller design. The comparisons of
  feasible region with FOPI and integer order PID (IOPID) controllers clearly present
  the superiority of proposed FOPIλD controller. Simulation illustration for delay
  dominant systems, lag dominant systems and high order system with one zero, using
  the proposed optimal robust FOPIλD controller is presented to demonstrate the significant
  performance improvement over FOPI controller, three-parameter FOPID controller,
  Ziegler–Nichols FOPID controller, fractional filter-FOPID controller and SIMC-PI
  controller.
