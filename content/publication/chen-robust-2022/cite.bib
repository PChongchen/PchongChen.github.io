 abstract = {This paper proposes a three-parameter fractional-order PID (TPFOPID) controller synthesis for the PMSM speed servo system. This TPFOPID contains complete proportional/integral/differential elements but with only three parameters to tune. A systematic design scheme of this TPFOPID to satisfy a flat phase constraint and two specifications, that is, gain crossover frequency (𝜔c) and phase margin (𝜙m), is presented for the PMSM speed servo system. Furthermore, the entire achievable region of 𝜔c and 𝜙m can be collected following the scheme. With this region, one can choose feasible combination specifications of 𝜔c and 𝜙m before the controller design. To show the effectiveness of the TPFOPID controller, the achievable region of specifications is compared with the fractional-order PI (FOPI) also with three parameters. Simulation illustration and experimental verifications using the TPFOPID for the PMSM speed servo system are presented and compared with those using FOPI controller, IOPI controller, and IOPID controller to demonstrate the advantages of the designed TPFOPID controller, and also compared with FOPID based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm to present comparable control performance.},
