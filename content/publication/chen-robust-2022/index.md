abstract: This paper proposes a three-parameter fractional-order PID (TPFOPID) controller
  synthesis for the PMSM speed servo system. This TPFOPID contains complete proportional/integral/differential
  elements but with only three parameters to tune. A systematic design scheme of this
  TPFOPID to satisfy a flat phase constraint and two specifications, that is, gain
  crossover frequency (𝜔c) and phase margin (𝜙m), is presented for the PMSM speed
  servo system. Furthermore, the entire achievable region of 𝜔c and 𝜙m can be collected
  following the scheme. With this region, one can choose feasible combination specifications
  of 𝜔c and 𝜙m before the controller design. To show the effectiveness of the TPFOPID
  controller, the achievable region of specifications is compared with the fractional-order
  PI (FOPI) also with three parameters. Simulation illustration and experimental verifications
  using the TPFOPID for the PMSM speed servo system are presented and compared with
  those using FOPI controller, IOPI controller, and IOPID controller to demonstrate
  the advantages of the designed TPFOPID controller, and also compared with FOPID
  based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm to present comparable control performance.
