 abstract = {In this paper, a speed control scheme based on an analytically designed fractional-order PID with Bodes ideal cut-off filter (FOPID-BICO) is proposed. The FOPID controller is designed to track the speed references and the BICO filter is applied to filter the high frequency noise. Considering the difficulty of parameters tuning of the FOPID controller, a comprehensive analytical design method based on frequency specifications defined loop-shaping for the FOPID-BICO controller is proposed for the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed control. The designed speed servo system satisfies five frequency-domain indicators: gain crossover frequency, phase margin, phase crossover frequency, gain margin and a flat phase constraint. Moreover, the influence of phase crossover frequency on control system is fully exposed through the frequency-domain analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed FOPID-BICO controller has been verified by both simulation and experimental results.},
