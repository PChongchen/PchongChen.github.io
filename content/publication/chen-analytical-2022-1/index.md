abstract: 'In this paper, a speed control scheme based on an analytically designed
  fractional-order PID with Bodes ideal cut-off filter (FOPID-BICO) is proposed. The
  FOPID controller is designed to track the speed references and the BICO filter is
  applied to filter the high frequency noise. Considering the difficulty of parameters
  tuning of the FOPID controller, a comprehensive analytical design method based on
  frequency specifications defined loop-shaping for the FOPID-BICO controller is proposed
  for the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed control. The designed speed
  servo system satisfies five frequency-domain indicators: gain crossover frequency,
  phase margin, phase crossover frequency, gain margin and a flat phase constraint.
  Moreover, the influence of phase crossover frequency on control system is fully
  exposed through the frequency-domain analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed
  FOPID-BICO controller has been verified by both simulation and experimental results.'
