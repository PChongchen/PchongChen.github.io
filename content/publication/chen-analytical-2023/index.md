abstract: 'In this article, a speed control scheme based on an analytically designed
  fractional-order PID with Bode’s ideal cutoff (FOPID-BICO) filter is proposed. The
  FOPID controller is designed to track the speed references and the BICO suppress
  is applied to filter the high-frequency noise. Considering the difficulty of parameters
  tuning of the FOPID controller, a comprehensive analytical design method based on
  frequency specifications-defined loop-shaping for the FOPID-BICO controller is first
  proposed for the permanent magnet synchronous motor speed control. The designed
  speed servo system satisfies five frequency-domain specifications: gain crossover
  frequency, phase margin, phase crossover frequency, gain margin, and a “flat phase”
  constraint. Moreover, the influence of phase crossover frequency on control system
  is fully exposed through the frequency-domain analysis. The proposed designed method
  ensures that the control system is robust to loop gain variations and guarantees
  the optimal performance on rejecting noise in high-frequency and disturbance in
  low-frequency. The effectiveness of the proposed FOPID-BICO controller has been
  verified by experimental results.'
