 abstract = {In this article, a speed control scheme based on an analytically designed fractional-order PID with Bode’s ideal cutoff (FOPID-BICO) filter is proposed. The FOPID controller is designed to track the speed references and the BICO suppress is applied to filter the high-frequency noise. Considering the difficulty of parameters tuning of the FOPID controller, a comprehensive analytical design method based on frequency specifications-defined loop-shaping for the FOPID-BICO controller is first proposed for the permanent magnet synchronous motor speed control. The designed speed servo system satisfies five frequency-domain specifications: gain crossover frequency, phase margin, phase crossover frequency, gain margin, and a “flat phase” constraint. Moreover, the influence of phase crossover frequency on control system is fully exposed through the frequency-domain analysis. The proposed designed method ensures that the control system is robust to loop gain variations and guarantees the optimal performance on rejecting noise in high-frequency and disturbance in low-frequency. The effectiveness of the proposed FOPID-BICO controller has been verified by experimental results.},
