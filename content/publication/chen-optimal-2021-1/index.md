abstract: In this paper, a fractional-order active disturbance rejection controller
  (FOADRC), combining a fractional-order proportional derivative (FOPD) controller
  and an extended state observer (ESO), is proposed for a permanent magnet synchronous
  motor (PMSM) speed servo system. The global stable region in the parameter (Kp,
  Kd, µ)-space corresponding to the observer bandwidth ωo can be obtained by D-decomposition
  method. To achieve a satisﬁed tracking and anti-load disturbance performance, an
  optimal ADRC tuning strategy is proposed. This tuning strategy is applicable to
  both FOADRC and integer-order active disturbance rejection controller (IOADRC).
  The tuning method not only meets user-speciﬁed frequency-domain indicators but also
  achieves a time-domain performance index. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed FOADRC achieves better speed tracking, and more robustness to
  external disturbance performances than traditional IOADRC and typical Proportional-Integral-Derivative
  (PID) controller. For example, the JITAE for speed tracking of the designed FOADRC
  are less than 52.59% and 55.36% of the JITAE of IOADRC and PID controller, respectively.
  Besides, the JITAE for anti-load disturbance of the designed FOADRC are less than
  17.11% and 52.50% of the JITAE of IOADRC and PID controller, respectively.
