	abstract = {This paper proposed a comprehensive synthesis of fractional order PIλDµ (FOPIλDµ) controller analytical design, which is illustrated through the typical first order plus normalized time delay (FOPNTD) systems, with fulfilling five frequency-domain specifications simultaneously: phase margin (φm), gain margin (Am), phase crossover frequency (ωpc ), gain crossover frequency (ωgc ) and a ‘‘flat phase’’ constraint. The control loop shape can be adjusted with wide freedom according to the five design specifications, which can all be beneficial on optimizing the control system: ωgc represents the system control bandwidth and response speed, φm and Am guarantee the stability, and flat phase constraint keeps the system with iso-damping property on robustness of loop gain variations. The impact of ωpc adjustment is thoroughly discovered via frequency-domain analysis and also time-domain analysis with low-frequency disturbance and high-frequency noise. The frequency response functions are presented to show the loop-shaping advantages of the proposed synthesis scheme. A further in-depth study on designing guideline is also presented: the feasible region of four specifications, e.g. ωgc , ωpc , φm and Am, can all be collected and visualized in the multi-dimensional graphics. This feasible region gives users prior information and great flexibility before the controller design. Simulation results using the designed FOPIλDµ controller are carried out to demonstrate the performance advantages over the optimized integer-order PID, three-parameter FOPID, fractional filter-fractional order PID and Ziegler–Nichols FOPID controllers.},

The FD specifications (i.e. phase margin (PM), gain crossover frequency (ωgc ) and flat phase constrain (FPC)) guarantee the systemic stability and robustness to plant gain variations. Meanwhile, the TD specification (i.e. the smallest JITAE ) achieves optimal dynamic performance. Furthermore, the entire feasible regions of two frequency-domain specifications ωgc and PM have been obtained with a synthesis scheme and visualized in three-dimensional plots which can be used as prior knowledge before the controller design. The comparisons of feasible region with FOPI and integer order PID (IOPID) controllers clearly present the superiority of proposed FOPIλD controller. Simulation illustration for delay dominant systems, lag dominant systems and high order system with one zero, using the proposed optimal robust FOPIλD controller is presented to demonstrate the significant performance improvement over FOPI controller, three-parameter FOPID controller, Ziegler–Nichols FOPID controller, fractional filter-FOPID controller and SIMC-PI controller.},

The GESO simplifies the control plant, estimates and actively rejects total disturbances. The FOPD controller achieves fast speed tracking with almost no overshoot. Furthermore, it is verified that the control system with the proposed FOPD-GESO controller design meets the separation principle through mathematical derivation and simulation illustration. It shows that the proposed controller breaks the inherent tradeoff on tracking performance and disturbance robustness of the typical traditional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control. Meanwhile, a systematic scheme for designing the FOPD-GESO controller to satisfy both frequency-domain and time-domain specifications is proposed in this article. Simulation illustration and experimental validation are performed to demonstrate that the proposed FOPD-GESO controller is superior to the typical integer-order PID controller, integer-order active disturbance rejection control with a typical extended state observer, and fractional-order PID controller in terms of speed tracking, antiload disturbance, and robustness to internal uncertainties.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a fractional order (FO)-active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with a FO extended state observer (FOESO) design. Applying this FOESO, a typical second order motion plant can be converted into a cascaded fractional order integrator (1/s2r ; 0 {\textless} r {\textless} 1) with considering all other dynamics and internal/external disturbances as total disturbances. Therefore, a single proportional controller which is not sensitive to system noise can realize a stable control system. According to the frequency characteristics of equivalent FO system model, the FO-ADRC control system is robust to systematic uncertain dynamics and disturbances. Furthermore, without differential action which is needed for the typical double integrator plant control, the proposed control system achieves good robustness to high-frequency noise. Simulation and experiments on PMSM speed servo system are performed, showing that the proposed FO-ADRC behaves better than integer order ADRC (IO-ADRC) and FOPI controller. This FO-ADRC methodology can be simply extended to general control plants.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a fractional-order active disturbance rejection controller (FOADRC), combining a fractional-order proportional derivative (FOPD) controller and an extended state observer (ESO), is proposed for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed servo system. The global stable region in the parameter (Kp, Kd, µ)-space corresponding to the observer bandwidth ωo can be obtained by D-decomposition method. To achieve a satisﬁed tracking and anti-load disturbance performance, an optimal ADRC tuning strategy is proposed. This tuning strategy is applicable to both FOADRC and integer-order active disturbance rejection controller (IOADRC). The tuning method not only meets user-speciﬁed frequency-domain indicators but also achieves a time-domain performance index. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FOADRC achieves better speed tracking, and more robustness to external disturbance performances than traditional IOADRC and typical Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. For example, the JITAE for speed tracking of the designed FOADRC are less than 52.59\% and 55.36\% of the JITAE of IOADRC and PID controller, respectively. Besides, the JITAE for anti-load disturbance of the designed FOADRC are less than 17.11\% and 52.50\% of the JITAE of IOADRC and PID controller, respectively.},

Furthermore, the entire achievable region of 𝜔c and 𝜙m can be collected following the scheme. With this region, one can choose feasible combination specifications of 𝜔c and 𝜙m before the controller design. To show the effectiveness of the TPFOPID controller, the achievable region of specifications is compared with the fractional-order PI (FOPI) also with three parameters. Simulation illustration and experimental verifications using the TPFOPID for the PMSM speed servo system are presented and compared with those using FOPI controller, IOPI controller, and IOPID controller to demonstrate the advantages of the designed TPFOPID controller, and also compared with FOPID based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm to present comparable control performance.},
